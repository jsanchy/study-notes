# Chapter 2

### Strict Mode
Use it! Tightens rules to make code safer and more optimizable.

### Old & New

Polyfill: code a newer feature so that it has the same behavior in older JS environments. Book's example: ES6 utility called Number.isNaN(), deprecating isNaN().

Transpile: can't polyfill new syntax, would throw an error. Use tool (transpiler) in build process to convert to code for older environments. Book's example: ES6 feature called default parameter values.
